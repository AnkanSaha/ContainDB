# ContainDB

ContainDB is a CLI tool written in Go that automates the installation and management of popular database containers (MongoDB, Redis, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra) as well as PHPMyAdmin and MongoDB Compass. It handles Docker installation (if missing), network setup, container orchestration, optional port mapping, restart policies, and data persistence.
